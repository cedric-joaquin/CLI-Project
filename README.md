# CLI::Project

The Supreme Auto Checkout app lets you browse and "shop" the `https://www.supremenewyork.com/shop/all` website using a command line interface. The program scrapes the available products on the website and allows you to add the products to your cart and simulate a checkout.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'CLI-Project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install CLI-Project

## Usage

Navigating the app is done by inputting the desired selection when given a list of numbered options available.  All inputs needed will be specified and entered through the command line. After adding a product to cart, you can choose to proceed to checkout or continue shopping. After a successful checkout you are able to create a new cart or exit the program.
